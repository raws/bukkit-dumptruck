Dumptruck is a [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) plugin for quickly generating a large swath of terrain around your server's spawn point.

Dumptruck focuses on speed and simplicity, and is ideal for previewing map seeds or tweaking custom terrain generation parameters.

### Installation and usage

To install Dumptruck, simply drop `Dumptruck.jar` into your Bukkit server's `plugins` directory.

When loading lots of terrain at speed, the more RAM, the better -- Java's VM will generally siphon up as much as you give it via `-Xms` and `-Xmx`:

    java -Xms4G -Xmx4G -Xincgc -jar craftbukkit.jar

If memory efficiency is your priority over speed, you may want to look into a tool like Morlok8k's useful [Minecraft Land Generator](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/187737-minecraft-land-generator/).

Dumptruck is meant to be used on an empty, inaccessible server where all available resources can be put to work creating your world. If there _are_ players connected, Dumptruck will try not to unload any occupied chunks. However, this may incite a performance penalty, and Dumptruck makes no guarantees about chunk safety! Tread carefully on live servers.

Dumptruck exposes one simple command. To generate chunks of terrain around the server's spawn point, use:

    dumptruck <radius>

Where `<radius>` is a number of chunks to generate around the spawn point.

Dumptruck is meant to be used from the server's console, but server ops (and anyone with the `dumptruck` permission) may also use `/dumptruck` in-game.
